Need on GitHub or other things I need to fix: 

- Test entire pipeline.  
- Example of nextflow 
- Example of all code in Cell Ranger run 
- Example of TREX 
- All tools used, BUT ONLY THE ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY USED. Trim the parts not used.  
- Rewrite and rerun optimize_n_neighbors keeping only silhouette score.
